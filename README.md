# OpenLink
[NeoLink's](https://googol.neocities.org/neolink/) source code but it's on GitHub.

## Why?
Most of the ad services on Neocities ([BannerLink](https://wsmz.gay/#misc-bannerlink), [NavLink](https://dimden.dev/navlinkads/), [ButtonLink](https://anoldnet.ichi.city/button-link/) are based on NeoLink's source code.

I made it open-source because I want it to be open for user contributions without needing to send an E-Mail to a webmaster just to add you to the ad service, and because I want other people to make their own ad services as well!

You can also check out [Linkshuffle](https://dabric.neocities.org/post/linkshuffle) if you want!

## Guidelines
To get accepted into OpenLink, you must adhere to the following:

* You must have a website. If not, then [go make one](https://pages.github.com)!
* Your site must not contain any bigotory or CP.
* If your site is NSFW, please use content warning that informs users before entering your site.
* No crypto.
* Commercial sites are prohibited too.
* Don't use a site builer (WYSIWYG editors and static site generators are fine).

## Note
OpenLink, as well as it's base and the countless modifications are not commercial. Meaning you can't make money from it, sorry about that!

Think of it as an image-based webring.
